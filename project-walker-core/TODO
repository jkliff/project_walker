Todo for project project-walker-core:

Bugs:


Unsure:
- currently the reporting facility occurs only at the end. maybe it is interesting to report errors immediatelly
- need to figure out if TreeWalker itself must provide some sort osupport for chaining of data through pre_visit, visit and post_visit node calls.

Core features:
- have a command line interface (suggestion: ArgumentParser makes this really easy: http://docs.python.org/library/argparse.html)
- output messages to log according to evaluation of the execution 
- possibility to run as configured a series of check rules

Nice to have:

- definition of predicates, to
- enable the execution of checks conditionally
- If we were to write useful concrete checks they should go into some sort of 'library structure' from where they could be loaded.
